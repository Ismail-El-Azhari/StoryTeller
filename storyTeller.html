    <h3>The Story of the Queen, the Traveler, and the Wolf Tracks</h3>
    <p>Imagine a kingdom where a wise queen rules. In her land, there's a vast enchanted forest filled with mystical creatures, some friendly and some dangerous. Travelers often pass through this forest, but they always seek advice from the queen before entering, hoping to know whether the path they take is safe.</p>

    <p>Now, the queen has a special ability: she doesn’t just rely on rumors or guesses to give advice, but she uses Bayesian probability to update her beliefs based on information she receives. Let me tell you how this works in the form of a story.</p>

    <p> One day, the wise queen sat in her castle when a traveler named Alden approached her. Alden sought her guidance because he needed to pass through the enchanted forest, but there were rumors of wolves along the path. He was anxious and wanted to know whether it was safe.</p>
      
    <p>The queen, being wise and analytical, relied on her deep knowledge and the power of Bayesian probability to help travelers like Alden. She knew from years of observing the forest that on any given day, there was a 20% chance of wolves being present. This was her prior probability—the baseline belief before she heard anything new.</p>
      
    <p> This meant:<br>
      
      The prior probability of wolves being present (P(Wolves)) = 20% = 0.20
      The probability of no wolves (P(No Wolves)) = 80% = 0.80
      As Alden told his story, he shared some fresh information: “I met another traveler on the way who claimed to have seen wolf tracks along the path.” </p>
      
    <p> Now, the queen knew from past experience that travelers' reports of wolf tracks weren't always accurate. She estimated that when wolves were present, there was a 60% chance that travelers would correctly see wolf tracks. This is the likelihood—the probability of seeing wolf tracks given that wolves are present (P(Tracks | Wolves)).</p>
      
    <p> P(Tracks | Wolves) = 60% = 0.60
      But the queen also knew that travelers sometimes falsely reported seeing wolf tracks when wolves weren’t actually there. From her observations, travelers gave false reports of wolf tracks 30% of the time, even when there were no wolves. This is another likelihood, but in reverse—the probability of seeing wolf tracks even if wolves aren’t there (P(Tracks | No Wolves)). </p>
      
    <p> P(Tracks | No Wolves) = 30% = 0.30
      Now the queen had everything she needed to update her belief about the presence of wolves using Bayes' Theorem.</p>
      
    <p>  Bayes’ Theorem says: <br>
      <p>
        \( P(\text{Wolves}|\text{Tracks}) = \frac{P(\text{Tracks}|\text{Wolves}) \times P(\text{Wolves})}{P(\text{Tracks})} \)
      </p> 

    <p> Where:

      
      
      P(Wolves∣Tracks) is the posterior probability—the updated belief about wolves being present given the report of tracks.

    </p>
      P(Tracks∣Wolves) is the probability of seeing tracks if wolves are present (which is 0.60).

      𝑒
      𝑠
      )
      P(Tracks)=P(Tracks∣Wolves)×P(Wolves)+P(Tracks∣NoWolves)×P(NoWolves)
      Let’s plug in the numbers:
      
      𝑃
      (
      𝑇
      𝑟
      𝑎
      𝑐
      𝑘
      𝑠
      )
      =
      (
      0.60
      ×
      0.20
      )
      +
      (
      0.30
      ×
      0.80
      )
      P(Tracks)=(0.60×0.20)+(0.30×0.80)
      𝑃
      (
      𝑇
      𝑟
      𝑎
      𝑐
      𝑘
      𝑠
      )
      =
      0.12
      +
      0.24
      =
      0.36
      P(Tracks)=0.12+0.24=0.36
      Now that the queen knows the total probability of tracks being reported (0.36), she can calculate the posterior probability of wolves being present:
      
      𝑃
      (
      𝑊
      𝑜
      𝑙
      𝑣
      𝑒
      𝑠
      ∣
      𝑇
      𝑟
      𝑎
      𝑐
      𝑘
      𝑠
      )
      =
      0.60
      ×
      0.20
      0.36
      P(Wolves∣Tracks)= 
      0.36
      0.60×0.20
      ​
       
      𝑃
      (
      𝑊
      𝑜
      𝑙
      𝑣
      𝑒
      𝑠
      ∣
      𝑇
      𝑟
      𝑎
      𝑐
      𝑘
      𝑠
      )
      =
      0.12
      0.36
      =
      0.33
      P(Wolves∣Tracks)= 
      0.36
      0.12
      ​
       =0.33

      <p>The queen realized her initial belief about wolves being present, after hearing about the tracks, should now be 33%. The likelihood of wolves was higher than before Alden spoke to her, but not as high as she initially thought.</p>
      
      <p>The Conversation Continues...<br>
      The queen paused. Alden, still looking uneasy, said, “What if more travelers confirm the wolf tracks?”</p>
      
      <p>Later that day, two more travelers arrived at the castle and each independently reported seeing the same wolf tracks. The queen, understanding that more evidence could further adjust her belief, used Bayesian updating once more, stacking the evidence.</p>
      
      <p>With multiple consistent reports, her belief that wolves were present would grow stronger. But even then, she never abandoned her initial knowledge or ignored the possibility that travelers could make mistakes. She updated her belief step by step, refining her judgment carefully.</p>
      
      <p>The Lesson (with Math)
      Bayesian probability is about updating your beliefs when new evidence comes in. Initially, the queen started with a prior—a 20% chance that wolves were in the forest. Then, after receiving new evidence (the report of wolf tracks) and factoring in the reliability of that evidence, she recalculated the chance of wolves being present, arriving at a posterior probability of 33%.</p>
      
      <p>If more reports came in, the queen would continue updating her belief. The key is that Bayesian reasoning never throws away the old information. Instead, it balances the prior belief with the new evidence to arrive at a more accurate understanding of the world.</p>
      
      <p>This is how the queen wisely navigated the world of uncertainty, just as we can when faced with uncertain situations in real life.</p>
